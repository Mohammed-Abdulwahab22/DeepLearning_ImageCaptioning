# DeepLearning_ImageCaptioning

This repository contains an image captioning model that generates descriptive captions for input images. The model is built using VGG16 & LSTM and trained on flickr-8k-dataset.

## Features

- **Image Captioning:** Given an input image, the model generates a descriptive caption.
- **Pre-trained Model:** You can use the pre-trained model out of the box, or train your own on a custom dataset.
